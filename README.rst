New Relic OpenTelemetry Python Exporter
=======================================

An
`OpenTelemetry <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python>`__
exporter for sending spans to New Relic using the New Relic Python
Telemetry SDK. Currently, spans as of OpenTelemetry v0.15b0 are
supported. For details on how OpenTelemetry data is mapped to New Relic
data, see documentation in `our exporter specifications
documentation <https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-exporter-specs>`__.

Installation
------------

To start, the ``opentelemetry-ext-newrelic`` package must be installed.
To install through pip:

.. code:: python

       $ pip install opentelemetry-ext-newrelic

If that fails, download the library from its GitHub page and install it
using:

.. code:: python

       $ python setup.py install

Getting Started
---------------

In order to use the exporter, you will need to set the
``NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY`` environment variable with your `Insights Insert
API
Key <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/introduction-event-api#>`__.

Using the span exporter
-----------------------

The following code sample assumes you have set the
``NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY`` environment variable and installed the
following packages:

-  ``opentelemetry-ext-newrelic``

.. code:: python

   import os
   from opentelemetry import trace
   from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
   from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchExportSpanProcessor
   from opentelemetry_ext_newrelic import NewRelicSpanExporter
   from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider

   trace.set_tracer_provider(
       TracerProvider(resource=Resource.create({"service.name": "otel-python"}))
   )

   trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(
       BatchExportSpanProcessor(
           NewRelicSpanExporter(
               os.environ["NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY"], 
           ),
           schedule_delay_millis=500,
       )
   )

   tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
   with tracer.start_as_current_span("foo"):
       with tracer.start_as_current_span("bar"):
           print("Hello World from OpenTelemetry Python!")

..

Using the span exporter with auto-instrumentation
-------------------------------------------------

The following code sample assumes you have set the
``NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY`` environment variable and installed the
following packages:

-  ``opentelemetry-ext-newrelic``
-  ``opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask``
-  ``flask``

.. code:: python

   import os
   from opentelemetry import trace
   from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
   from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
   from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
   from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchExportSpanProcessor
   from opentelemetry_ext_newrelic import NewRelicSpanExporter
   from flask import Flask
   app = Flask(__name__)
   FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
   trace.set_tracer_provider(
       TracerProvider(resource=Resource.create({"service.name": "otel-python-flask"}))
   )

   trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(
       BatchExportSpanProcessor(
           NewRelicSpanExporter(os.environ["NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY"]),
           schedule_delay_millis=500,
       )
   )

   @app.route("/")
   def hello_world():
       return "Hello World!"

   @app.route("/error")
   def raise_500():
       raise RuntimeError("Something happened!")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       app.run(port=8080)
